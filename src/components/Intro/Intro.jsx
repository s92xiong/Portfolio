      <p>Hi! My name is Sheuh Xiong.</p>
      <p>I'm an aspiring front-end developer who builds stuff with HTML/CSS, Javascript, React, and Firebase. Presently, I'm working through an online curriculum called The Odin Project where I can expand my dev skills.</p>
      <p>My hobbies come and go. In the past I've enjoyed Brazilian jiu-jitsu and Olympic weightlifting. Since the pandemic I've recently been playing Go/baduk, cooking, hiking, and doing calisthenics.</p>
